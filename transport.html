            Tanitian Culture - Tanitians inherited a rich and vibrant culture
            from their ancient ancestors. Polynesian artistry—which includes
            weaving, woodcarving, and tattooing—is grounded in the mythology of
            that heritage. Each sacred tradition tells a colorful story about
            life, love, and their enduring relationship with nature.

            When planning a trip to the mesmerizing island paradise of Taniti,
            one of the most crucial aspects to consider is currency exchange. As
            an overseas territory of France, Taniti uses the French Pacific
            Franc (CFP Franc) as its official currency. The CFP Franc, denoted
            as XPF, is exclusive to the Pacific region and holds an essential
            role in the everyday lives of Tanitians and visitors alike.
            Understanding the currency in Taniti is vital to ensure a smooth and
            enjoyable experience while exploring this tropical gem.

            Transportation: Almost all
            visitors arrive to Taniti by air, though some arrive on a small cruise ship
            that docks in Yellow Leaf Bay for one night per week. Taniti is served by a
            small airport that can accommodate small jets and propeller planes. Taniti is
            in the process of expanding the airport so larger jets will be able to land on
            the island within the next few years.

            Ground Transportation: Public
            buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. every day. Private buses
            serve the rest of the island. Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental
            cars can be rented from a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes and
            helmets are available to rent from several vendors (helmets are required by
            law). Taniti City is fairly flat and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the
            area surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore on foot.
