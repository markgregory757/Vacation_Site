            Tanitian Culture - Tanitians inherited a rich and vibrant culture
            from their ancient ancestors. Polynesian artistry—which includes
            weaving, woodcarving, and tattooing—is grounded in the mythology of
            that heritage. Each sacred tradition tells a colorful story about
            life, love, and their enduring relationship with nature.

            When planning a trip to the mesmerizing island paradise of Taniti,
            one of the most crucial aspects to consider is currency exchange. As
            an overseas territory of France, Taniti uses the French Pacific
            Franc (CFP Franc) as its official currency. The CFP Franc, denoted
            as XPF, is exclusive to the Pacific region and holds an essential
            role in the everyday lives of Tanitians and visitors alike.
            Understanding the currency in Taniti is vital to ensure a smooth and
            enjoyable experience while exploring this tropical gem.

            Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the island
            has an area of less than 500 square miles, the terrain is varied and
            includes both sandy and rocky beaches, a small but safe harbor, lush
            tropical rainforests, and a mountainous interior that includes a
            small, active volcano. Taniti has an indigenous population of about
            20,000. Until a recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy
            was dominated by fishing or agriculture.
